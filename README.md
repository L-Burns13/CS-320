How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure functionality and security by following a structured testing process and using automated tools to detect potential issues early. Security starts at the design phase, so I will write clean, modular code, apply input validation, and regularly update dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities. Continuous testing and code reviews help maintain reliability throughout development.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I will interpret user needs by gathering feedback through interviews, surveys, and analytics to understand their goals and challenges. From there, I will translate those insights into clear software requirements and design features that directly address user expectations. This approach will ensure the final product is practical, efficient, and user-centered.

How do I approach designing software?
I will begin by analyzing requirements and planning the overall structure of the project. Once the goals are clear, I will design the architecture, define technical components, and outline how they will interact. This approach will help create scalable, maintainable software that meets both user and business needs.
